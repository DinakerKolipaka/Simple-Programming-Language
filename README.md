Project name: Simple Programming Language
Team Members: Dinaker Prakash Kolipaka
              Manju Bisht
              Ramya Varakantham

System on which compiler and runtime are built: <br>
OS on which our language would work on: Windows <br>
OS on which our language would not work on: MacOS <br>

Tools used: SWI Prolog

Languages used: Prolog
     
Directions on how to install and run the project (compiler + runtime):
1. Download the Project and unzip it. <br>
2. Click on the install.bat file from the src folder to start the Installation steps. <br>
3. This will open the requisite Prolog compiler in your system such as SWI-Prolog or GProlog with the language file loaded. <br>
4. In the Prolog window enter the following predicate:
execute_SPL('path_to_program_file'). <br>
5. In case of errors opening the .bat file, open the sourceCode.pl file from the src folder and execute the aforementioned command.
