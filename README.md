Directions on how to install and run the project (compiler + runtime):
1. Download the Project and unzip it.
2. Click on the install.bat file from the src folder to start the Installation steps.
3. This will open the requisite Prolog compiler in your system such as SWI-Prolog or GProlog with the language file loaded.
4. In the Prolog window enter the following predicate:
execute_SPL('path_to_program_file').
5. In case of errors opening the .bat file, open the sourceCode.pl file from the src folder and execute the aforementioned command.
